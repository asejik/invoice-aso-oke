🐛 Troubleshooting
PDF Generation Fails in Production
This project uses Node Polyfills (buffer, process) to allow the PDF engine to run in the browser.

If you encounter Buffer is not defined, ensure src/types/window.d.ts exists.

If you see __SECRET_INTERNALS... error, ensure you are running React 18, not React 19.

React Version Conflict
If dependencies try to install React 19, run:

Bash

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
The package.json contains an overrides section to enforce React 18.
